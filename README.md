### Classification algorithms (SpamClassifier)

> Here are our exercises of implementing classification algorithms in Python using sci-kit learn and other libraries. It written in Python-3.6.7. Dependencies are available in `requirements.txt` file. You may have to install tkinter. Follow this instruction:

```
$ # on the debian-based OS like Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

You can see `DOCUMENT.md` for more information.

#### Dataset

> We used standard dataset named `spambase`. You can find it in dataset directory of our repository. This program support all of `arff` datasets that the class-label is in the last column.

#### Algorithms

1. kNN
2. Naive bayes
3. Decision tree
4. SVM
5. Random forest

TODO: **With neural-networks**

#### Results

The result contains the confusion matrix and the accuracy of each algorithm and will be available in the results directory.
